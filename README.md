# Udacity-Tournament-Project

project description:
======================================
Tournament project for Udaicty. This program has all the functions necessary to handle a swiss style tournament including adding players to the tournament, counting players, deleteing matches, deleting players, returning their current standing in the tournament, and pairing them against players with similar win amounts.

how to install and run:
================================
To install this program download it as zip from github, create a postgresql database called tournament and import the table structure from tournament.sql using \i tournament.sql if on unix, then run tournament_test with python using python tournament_test.py while in the same directory as the tournament test file.

AUTHORS:
======================
I (Kyle Lick) wrote the code in tournament.py with the exception that udaicty provided the structure of each function as well as the documentation inside

Udacity provided the tournament_test class as well.

I got some suggestions from the udacity forums as well as stackoverflow on a few things. I can't remember everything I read to give proper credit sorry .-.
